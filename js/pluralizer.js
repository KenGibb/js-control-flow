// Write a program that starts like...
let thing = 'cat';
let count = 5;
// and outputs the pluralized form of the word, depending on what count is. For example, "5 cats" or "1 dog". Change thing to different values to test your code!
// Your program should pluralize the word based on an integer (count)
